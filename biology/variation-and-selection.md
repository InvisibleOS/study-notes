# Variation and selection

## Variation

#### Variation: difference between individuals of the same species

| Phenotypic variation                             | Genotypic variation            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Caused by both genetic and environmental factors | Caused by genetic factors only |
| Example: height                                  | Example: eye colour            |

| Continuous variation                                                                    | Discontinuous variation                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Continuous variation results in a range of phenotypes between two extremes, e.g. height | Discontinuous variation results in a limited number of phenotypes with no intermediates, e.g. tongue rolling |

* **Discontinuous variation is most likely caused by genes alone, e.g. blood groups in humans**

## Mutation

#### Gene mutation: a change in the base sequence of a DNA

* It is how new alleles are formed
* Ionizing radiation and some chemicals increase the rate of mutation

## Sickle-cell anemia

### Symptoms

* Shortness of breath
* Pain in joints
* High blood pressure
* Heart attack

| Sickle-cell | Normal blood cell |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| -CAT-       | -CTT-             |
| valine      | glutamic acid     |

* Faulty replication at meiosis
* Valine replaces glutamic acid

| Hb^A^Hb^S^ & Hb^A^Hb^S^                                                                                                                   | -                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Hb^A^Hb^A^                                                                                                                                | reduced survival; selected against by malaria |
| Hb^A^Hb^S^                                                                                                                                | positive selection due to malaria resistance  |
| Hb^A^Hb^S^                                                                                                                                | positive selection due to malaria resistance  |
| Hb^S^Hb^S^                                                                                                                                | reduced survival; selected against by illness |
| #### Heterozygotes have no symptoms of anemia and are resistant to malaria as malaria parasite is unable to reproduce in the sickle cells |                                               |

## Adaptive features

#### Adaptive feature: inherited functional feature that help an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment and increase its fitness

#### Adaptations: the process, resulting from natural selection, by which populations become more suited to their environment over many generations

1. ### Pine tree (xerophyte)

* Small, compact, needle-like leaves
  * Low wind resistance; prevents wind damage
  * Reduces water lost in transpiration
* Sunken stomata
  * Create high humidity
  * Reduce transpiration
* Thick waxy cuticle
  * Prevents transpiration from the surface of the leaf

1. ### Cacti (xerophyte)

* No leaves, or leaves reduced to spines
  * Reduces surface area for transpiration
  * Spines act as defense against herbivores
* Photosynthesis carried out by thick green stem
  * Transpiration is reduced
* Water stored in fleshy tissues
  * This water can be used for photosynthesis
* Closure of stomata during daytime
  * Carbon dioxide diffuses through the open stomata at night and is 'fixed' into an organic acid
  * During daytime, the acid breaks down to yield carbon dioxide which is built into sugars by photosynthesis
  * Reduces water loss

1. ### Marram grass (xerophyte)

* Long roots
  * Grow deep down in the sand to search for water
* Leaves roll up into straw-like tubes
  * Stomata are sunken
  * Increases humidity and reduces transpiration

1. ### Water lily (hydrophyte)

* Leaves contain large air spaces
  * Makes them buoyant so they float
* Lower epidermis lacks stomata
  * Prevents water entering the air spaces
* Roots contain air spaces
  * Root cells need oxygen for respiration

## Selection

### Natural selection

1. Variation within populations
2. Production of many offsprings
3. Competition for resources
4. Struggle for survival
5. Reproduction by individuals that are better adapter to the environment than others
6. Passing on of their alleles to the next generation

#### Evolution: change in adaptive features of a population over time as a result of natural selection

Example: Development of strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria is an example of evolution by natural selection

### Selective breeding

* Selection by humans of individuals with desirable features
* Crossing these individuals to produce the next generation
* Selection of offspring showing the desirable features

### Difference between natural and artificial selection

| Natural selection                                                                                                                                | Artificial selection                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Occurs over many generations                                                                                                                     | Can be done quickly                                            |
| Individuals that are more adapted to the environment are likely to survive and pass the useful adaptive features and alleles to their offsprings | Offers no advantage to the organism in its natural environment |
| Useful characteristics are shown in the offspring                                                                                                | Desirable characteristics are shown in the organisms           |
