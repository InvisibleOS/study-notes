# Variation and selection



## Variation

#### Variation: difference between individuals of the same species

| Phenotypic variation                             | Genotypic variation            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Caused by both genetic and environmental factors | Caused by genetic factors only |
| Example: height                                  | Example: eye colour            |

| Continuous variation                                                                    | Discontinuous variation                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Continuous variation results in a range of phenotypes between two extremes, e.g. height | Discontinuous variation results in a limited number of phenotypes with no intermediates, e.g. tongue rolling |

* **Discontinuous variation is most likely caused by genes alone, e.g. blood groups in humans**

## Mutation

#### Gene mutation: a change in the base sequence of a DNA

* It is how new alleles are formed
* Ionizing radiation and some chemicals increase the rate of mutation

## Sickle-cell anemia

### Symptoms

* Shortness of breath
* Pain in joints
* High blood pressure
* Heart attack

| Sickle-cell | Normal blood cell |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| -CAT-       | -CTT-             |
| valine      | glutamic acid     |

* Faulty replication at meiosis
* Valine replaces glutamic acid

| Hb^A^Hb^S^ & Hb^A^Hb^S^ | Note                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Hb^A^Hb^A^              | reduced survival; selected against by malaria |
| Hb^A^Hb^S^              | positive selection due to malaria resistance  |
| Hb^A^Hb^S^              | positive selection due to malaria resistance  |
| Hb^S^Hb^S^              | reduced survival; selected against by illness |

**Heterozygotes have no symptoms of anemia and are resistant to malaria as malaria parasite is unable to reproduce in the sickle cells**

## Adaptive features

#### Adaptive feature: inherited functional feature that help an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment and increase its fitness

1. ### Pine tree (xerophyte)

* Small, compact, needle-like leaves
  * Low wind resistance; prevents wind damage
  * Reduces water lost in transpiration
* Sunken stomata
  * Create high humidity
  * Reduce transpiration
* Thick waxy cuticle
  * Prevents transpiration from the surface of the leaf

1. ### Cacti (xerophyte)

* No leaves, or leaves reduced to spines
  * Reduces surface area for transpiration
  * Spines act as defense against herbivores
* Photosynthesis carried out by thick green stem
  * Transpiration is reduced
* Water stored in fleshy tissues
  * This water can be used for photosynthesis
* Closure of stomata during daytime
  * Carbon dioxide diffuses through the open stomata at night and is 'fixed' into an organic acid
  * During daytime, the acid breaks down to yield carbon dioxide which is built into sugars by photosynthesis
  * Reduces water loss

1. ### Marram grass (xerophyte)

* Long roots
  * Grow deep down in the sand to search for water
* Leaves roll up into straw-like tubes
  * Stomata are sunken
  * Increases humidity and reduces transpiration

1. ### Water lily (hydrophyte)

* Leaves contain large air spaces
  * Makes them buoyant so they float
* Lower epidermis lacks stomata
  * Prevents water entering the air spaces
* Roots contain air spaces
  * Root cells need oxygen for respiration
