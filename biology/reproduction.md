# Reproduction

## Asexual reproduction

#### Asexual reproduction: a process resulting in the production of genetically identical offsprings from one parent

### Advantages

* The population can increase rapidly when the conditions are favourable.
* Only one parent is needed
* It is more time and energy efficient
* Useful characteristics from parents is passed on

Advantages in crop production:

* Only one successful crop with good characteristics is enough to produce many of the same kind

## Sexual reproduction

#### Sexual reproduction: a process involving the fusion of the nuclei of two gametes (sex cells) to form a zygote and the production of offspring that are genetically different from each other

* Haploid: nuclei of gametes
* Diploid: nucleus of zygote

#### Fertilization: the fusion of gamete nuclei

### Advantages

* Some unhelpful characteristics (and diseases) can be masked out
* Genetic variation
* Organisms can easily adapt to their environment and natural selection can take place

### Sexual reproduction in plants

#### Organs

| Part       | Function                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sepals     | Protects the flower when its in the bud                   |
| Petals     | Usually brightly coloured to attract insects to pollinate |
| Receptacle | Attaches the flower to the plant                          |

### Reproductive organs

|          Stamen (male)          |           Carpel/Pistil (female)           |
| :-----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
| Anther - produces pollen grains |          Stigma- traps any pollen          |
|  Filament - raises the anthers  |          Style - raises the stigma         |
|                -                | Ovary - contains the ovules (future seeds) |

#### Self pollination: transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower or different flower on the same plant

#### Cross pollination: transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a flower to the stigma of a flower on a different plant of the same species

You should know : Implications of self pollination or cross pollination in terms of : - Variation : - Adaptation : - Reliance on pollinators

### Fertilization

Grows when pollination takes place. Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma. After pollination, the style grows a pollen tube that extends to the ovary of the flower and the pollen grains (containing the male gametes) travel through this and reach the ovules and the gametes fuse, forming a zygote.

### Insect pollination vs wind pollination

## Pregnancy and birth

* After fertilisation in the **oviduct**, the zygote travels towards the **uterus**
* This takes about 3 days, during which time the zygote will divide several times to form a ball of cells known as an **embryo**
* In the uterus, the embryo embeds itself in the thick lining (**implantation**) and continues to grow and develop
* The gestation period for humans is **9 months**
* Major **development of organs** takes place within the **first 12 weeks**, during which time the embryo gets nutrients from the mother by **diffusion through the uterus lining**
* After this point the organs are all in place, the **placenta** has formed and the embryo is now called a **fetus**
* The remaining gestation time is used by the fetus to **grow bigger in size**
* The fetus is surrounded by an **amniotic sac** which contains **amniotic fluid**
* This protects the fetus during development by **cushioning it from bumps** to the mother’s abdomen
* The **umbilical cord** joins the fetus’s blood supply to the **placenta** for exchange of nutrients and removal of waste products

### Placenta

* During the gestation period the fetus develops and grows by gaining the **glucose, amino acids, fats**, **water** and **oxygen** it needs from the mother’s blood
* The bloods run opposite each other, never mixing, in the **placenta**
* The fetus’s blood connects to and from the placenta by the **umbilical cord**
* The mother’s blood also absorbs the **waste** from the fetus’s blood in the placenta; substances like **carbon dioxide** and **urea** are removed from the fetus’s blood so that they do not build up to dangerous levels
* Movement of all molecules across the placenta occurs by **diffusion** due to **difference in concentration gradients**
* The placenta is adapted for this diffusion by having a l**arge surface area** and a **thin wall** for efficient diffusion
* The placenta acts as a **barrier** to prevent toxins and pathogens getting into the fetus’s blood
* Not all **toxin molecules** or **pathogenic organisms** (such as **viruses**, eg **rubella**) are stopped from passing through the placenta (this usually depends on the size of the molecule)
* This is why pregnant women are advised **not to smoke during pregnancy** as molecules like **nicotine** can pass across the placenta
* After the baby has been born, the **umbilical cord is cut** – this does not hurt as there are no nerves in it, just two blood vessels
* It is tied off to prevent bleeding and shrivels up and falls off after a few days leaving the belly button behind
* The placenta detaches from the uterus wall shortly after birth and is pushed out due to contractions in the muscular wall of the uterus – known as the **afterbirth**

![The placenta, IGCSE & GCSE Biology revision notes](https://v1.nitrocdn.com/kDXDIJNDOaszRbpagqNqUtquAQQkiLpO/assets/static/optimized/rev-86a1fec/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-placenta.png)

### Stages of birth

* Amniotic sac breaks
* Muscles in the uterus wall contract
* Cervix dilates (gets wider)
* Baby passes out through the vagina
* Umbilical cord is tied and cut
* Afterbirth is delivered

### Antenatal Care

Whilst pregnant, expectant mothers are given advice on:

* **diet** including the need to take **folic acid** to prevent developmental issues with the fetus and the importance of a **balanced diet**
* **exercise** to stay fit
* health precautions such as **avoiding infections**, **tobacco**, **alcohol** and other **drugs**

### Breastfeeding vs bottle-feeding

* There is no risk of an allergic reaction to breast milk
* Breast milk is produced at the correct temperature
* There are no additives or preservatives in breast milk
* Breast milk does not require sterilization since there are no bacteria present that could cause intestinal disease
* There is no cost involved in using breast milk
* Breast milk does not to be prepared
* Breastfeeding triggers a reduction in the size of the mother's uterus

## Sex hormones

#### Secondary characteristics are controlled by the release of hormones – oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys

* The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones released from the **ovary** and the **pituitary gland** in the brain
* **Oestrogen** levels rise from day 1 to peak just before **day 14**
* This causes the **uterine wall to start thickening** and the **egg to mature**
* The peak in oestrogen occurs just before the egg is released
* **Progesterone** stays low from day 1 – 14 and starts to rise once ovulation has occurred
* The increasing levels **cause the uterine lining to thicken further**; a fall in progesterone levels causes the uterine lining to break down (**menstruation / ‘period’**)

### Changes in the levels of the pituitary hormones FSH and LH in the blood during the menstrual cycle

#### FSH

Produced by: pituitary gland Roles:

* causes an egg to start maturing in the ovary
* stimulates the **ovaries** to start releasing **oestrogen**

#### LH

Released when: oestrogen levels are at their peak Produced by: pituitary gland Roles:

* causes ovulation (release of egg/ovum)
* stimulates **ovaries** to produce **progesterone**

#### Oestrogen

Released when: the follicles develop Produced by:

* granulosa cells Roles:
* Develops **secondary characteristics**
* Develops and maintains **uterus lining**
* Causes negative feedback to **reduce FSH and LH**

#### Progesterone

Released when: the ovum has been released Produced by: corpus luteum (follicle that produced the ovum develops into the corpus luteum) Roles:

* Thickens and maintains **uterus lining**
* Thickens **cervical mucus**
* When this reduces, endometrium is broken and menstruation occurs

### Interaction between all four of the menstrual cycle hormones

* The pituitary gland produces **FSH** which stimulates the development of a **follicle** in the ovary
* An egg develops inside the follicle and the follicle produces the hormone **oestrogen**
* Oestrogen causes **growth and repair of the lining of the uterus wall** and inhibits production of **FSH**
* When oestrogen rises to a high enough level it stimulates the release of **LH** from the pituitary gland which causes **ovulation** (usually around day 14 of the cycle)
* The follicle becomes the **corpus luteum** and starts producing **progesterone**
* Progesterone **maintains the uterus lining** (the thickness of the uterus wall)
* If the ovum is not fertilised, the corpus luteum breaks down and progesterone levels drop
* This causes **menstruation**, where the uterus lining breaks down and is removed through the vagina – commonly known as having a period
* If pregnancy does occur the corpus luteum **continues to produce progesterone**, preventing the uterus lining from breaking down and **aborting** the pregnancy
* It does this until the **placenta** has developed, at which point it starts secreting progesterone and **continues to do so throughout the pregnancy**

## Birth control

![Types of birth control, IGCSE & GCSE Biology revision notes](https://v1.nitrocdn.com/kDXDIJNDOaszRbpagqNqUtquAQQkiLpO/assets/static/optimized/rev-86a1fec/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Types-of-birth-control.png) Hormones are used in contraception and fertility treatments

Artificial semination: injecting semen through a tube into the top of the uterus In vitro fertilization: gametes are extracted and mixed in a test tube. Of cell divisions takes place then embedded into the uterus wall.

Social implications include religious or moral objections.

## STIs

#### STI: an infection that is transmitted via body fluids through sexual contact

* STIs include AIDS and HIV
* STIs can be prevented using protection
* HIV affects the immune system; it decreases lymphocytes and reduce the ability to produce antibodies, which leads to AIDS
