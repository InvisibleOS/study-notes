# Extraction of Metals

| Metal | Name of ore | Chemical name of compound in the ore | Formula | Usual method of extraction                                             |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Iron  | Haematite   | Iron(III) oxide                      | Fe2O3   | Heat oxide with carbon                                                 |
| Zinc  | Zinc blende | Zinc sulfide                         | ZnS     | Sulfide is roasted in air and the oxide produced is heated with carbon |

## Zinc

1. The zinc ore is first concentrated by a process called froth flotation. During this, rock particles become soaked with water and sink to the bottom of the tank. However, zinc sulfide particles, into which water cannot soak, is carried to top of the tank by the air bubbles and are skimmed off and dried. This ore now contains 55-75% of zinc sulfide.
2. The zinc sulfide is then heated very strongly to convert it into the oxide: ![Image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/696291655082442762/908751109831663686/719807591869317201.png?width=1440\&height=179)
3. The zinc oxide is mixed with powdered coke in a furnace and heated very strongly to a temperature of approximately 1400oC. The zinc oxide is reduced by the coke to zinc: ![Image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/696291655082442762/908781707166097459/719807591869317201.png?width=1440\&height=172)
