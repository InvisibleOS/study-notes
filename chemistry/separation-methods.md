# Separation Methods

| Method                  | Mixture Type                                                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Filteration             | <p>Insoluble solid and liquid<br>Filtrate and residue obtained</p>       | <p>Insoluble solid: residue<br>Filtered solution: filtrate</p>                                                                                                                                    |
| Simple distillation     | <p>Liquid and solid<br>Solid and pure liquid obtained</p>                | <p>Mixture is boiled until boiling point of liquid. Liquid that evaporates is then condensed.<br>Direction of cold water in condenser is against gravity</p>                                      |
| Fractional distillation | <p>Liquid and liquid<br>Liquids obtained according to boiling points</p> | Solution is heated at boiling points of the liquids in it. Liquid that evaporates at the certain temperature is condensed to obtain pure liquid. This is repeated for all liquids in the solution |
| Evaporation             | <p>Liquid and liquid<br>Solid crystals are obtained</p>                  | Mixture is heated (on a petri dish) to evaporate the liquid and obtain dry solid                                                                                                                  |
| Crystallization         | <p>Liquid and liquid<br>Solid crystals are obtained</p>                  | Similar to evaporation but mixture is only heated until crystallization point. The mixture is then kept at a warm place where the remaining liquid evaporates and solid crystals form.            |

## Chromatography

1. **Baseline is drawn with pencil** on chromatography paper
   * Reason: Ink will dissolve in the solvent
2. Apply the samples to the paper on the baseline
3. Put the strip of paper inside a beaker with the solvent **such that the baseline stays above the level of the liquid**
   * Reason: If the baseline is below the level of the liquid, the samples will simply dissolve in the solvent instead of separating
4. Check the spots produced
5.  Compare to known Rf values
